# Arithmetic Circuits

This folder contains RTL implementations of fundamental arithmetic combinational circuits written in Verilog HDL.

## Circuits Implemented

- Half Adder  
- Full Adder  
- Full Adder using Two Half Adders  
- Half Subtractor  
- Full Subtractor  
- Full Subtractor using Two Half Subtractors  
- 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder  
- 4-bit Ripple Borrow Subtractor  
- Binary Adder Subtractor
- Simple ALU (1-bit)

## Files Included

Each design includes:
- Verilog source file (`.v`)
- Testbench (`_testbench.v`)
- RTL schematic image (optional)
- README file (per module, optional)

## Tools Used

- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado for simulation and synthesis

## How to Run

1. Open Vivado and create a new RTL project.
2. Add the Verilog source and testbench files.
3. Set the testbench as the top module.
4. Run behavioral simulation to verify outputs.
