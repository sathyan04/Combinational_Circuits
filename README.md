# Combinational Circuits

This repository contains Verilog HDL implementations of various combinational logic circuits. The projects are organized into four main categories for modularity and ease of understanding.

## Folder Structure

- Arithmetic_Circuits
- Data_Routing_Circuits
- Code_Converters
- Comparators_Checkers

## Tools Used

- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado  
- GitHub (for version control and publishing)

## Navigation

Each folder includes:

- Source Verilog modules  
- Corresponding testbenches  
- Synthesized schematic images (where available)  
- Individual `README.md` files for documentation
