# Combinational-Circuits

This repository contains basic combinational logic circuit designs implemented using Verilog HDL. These are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and VLSI design. The goal of this collection is to demonstrate each logic unit with its truth table, logic expression, Verilog code, and simulation testbench.

## What are Combinational Circuits?

Combinational circuits are digital circuits where the output depends only on the current inputs. They do not store any data or rely on previous inputs, meaning they have no memory. These circuits form the foundation of arithmetic logic units, data routing elements, and decision-making blocks in digital systems.

## Topics Covered

Each module in this repository includes:
- Logic description and truth table
- Simplified Boolean expressions
- Verilog module and testbench
- Schematic (generated via synthesis)
- Optional waveform or simulation screenshot

### Modules Included:
- Half Adder
- Half Subtractor
- Full Adder
- Full Subtractor
- 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder
- Multiplexer (2:1, 4:1, etc.)
- Demultiplexer
- Decoder
- Encoder
- Priority Encoder
- Comparator
- Parity Generator / Checker

## Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite
- GTKWave (optional for waveform analysis)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download specific modules.
2. Open the corresponding `.v` and testbench files in Vivado.
3. Run behavioral simulation and observe output.
4. Refer to the included schematic images for gate-level implementation.
